# v2.2.1 Release Notes

## Highlights
- Side collisions now trigger hitstop even when entities touch only at the edges.

## Fixed
- Edge contact in collision detection was ignored, letting side swipes pass without hitstop. Collision boxes now use inclusive edges (DS-10, DS-25, T-10, T-25).

## Compatibility
- No breaking changes; this is a patch release.
