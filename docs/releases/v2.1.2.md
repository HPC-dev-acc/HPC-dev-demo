# v2.1.2 Release Notes

## Highlights
- Preserve background image clarity in fullscreen by regenerating it with the canvas's CSS height.

## Fixed
- Background textures previously appeared blurry in fullscreen because they were scaled from a fixed height. The height is now based on the canvas size to render at native resolution.

## Compatibility
- No breaking changes; this is a patch release.
