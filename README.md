# Mario Demo

This project is a simple platformer demo inspired by classic 2D side-scrollers. The stage clear screen now includes a simple star animation effect, and sliding triggers a brief dust animation.

## Testing

Install dependencies and run the test suite:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

The tests verify collision handling and coin collection logic. Continuous integration runs the same command on each push and pull request.
